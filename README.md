# Cyber-Final-Project---Arduino-Serial-Data-Reader

As for the final project of my high school cyber class, I was tasked with creating a program that connects to an Arduino microcontroller and reads the data coming from the serial port.

How does it work: simply connect an arduino device to a computer, then create a new file on the app and click the "read serial data" button.
lastly, save the file using the menu.
